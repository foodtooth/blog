      For now, suffice it to say that because the source code was widely available, various organizations developed
      their own (incompatible) versions, which led to chaos. Two major versions developed, System V, from AT&T, and BSD
      (Berkeley Software Distribution) from the University of California at Berkeley. These had minor variants as well.
      To make it possible to write programs that could run on any UNIX system, IEEE developed a standard for UNIX, called
      POSIX, that most versions of UNIX now support. POSIX defines a minimal system-call interface that conformant UNIX
      systems must support. In fact, some other operating systems now also support the POSIX interface.
